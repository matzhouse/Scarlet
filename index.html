        <h1>Scarlet</h1>
	
	<p>An HTTP frontend, for Redis.</p>
	
	<h2>Installing</h2>
	
	<p>You can install Scarlet simply by running the following command (assuming you
	  have a Go environment setup):</p>
	
	<pre><code>go get github.com/nesv/Scarlet
	</code></pre>
	
<p>Alternately, if you would like to clone the repository and build it from there,
the sources also ship with a simple Makefile; all you have to do once you get
the repository cloned is run:</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>...and you will have a <code>Scarlet</code> executable in your current directory, that you
can move around, to wherever.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

and/or cool, then submit a pull request. If your work is good, and consistent,
then you will be added to the list of contributors.</p>

<h2>Future planning</h2>

<h3>Clustering &amp; Replication</h3>
<p>
  One of the upcoming goals for Scarlet is to have clustering support. You
  should eventually be able to bring together any number of Redis servers, and
  while we are at it, why not also throw in some master/slave failover
  handling? This would be complete with an automatic elections, and slave
  reassignments. The only catch being that you have to funnel all your traffic through Scarlet.
</p>

<h3>TCP load blanacer/proxy</h3>

<p>
  For times where you may want to take advantage of Scarlet's clustering 
  facilities, but do not want to use the HTTP interface, Scarlet should be
  able to proxy any of the usual <a href="http://redis.io/topics/protocol">
  Redis traffic</a>, as well as load balance between slaves.
</p>
<p>
  Also in this point, is the notion of automatically sending all write-op 
  commands to the top-level master node, and sending all read-op commands to
  slaves.
</p>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<p>
  What systems team doesn't love a good monitoring interface? Watch any
  number of upstream Redis nodes, from a dedicated machine, just to make sure
  everything is purring.
